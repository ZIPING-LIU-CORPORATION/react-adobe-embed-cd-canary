 - This status icon showcases the current Heart Beat status of Canary Runs scheduled indefinitely between an interval of time and/or ~upon a full code deployment of the react-adobe-embed component which passed its own integration testing to the point of having then resulted in the deployment of the static app page testing endpoint in which the canary needs to have notice of to ensure resiliency in canary testing without affects from code development polluting the intention of canary runs to find issues stemming from user interface anomalies that exist outside the realm of specific code alterations, but rather that are a result of page rendering behavior due to the users browser environment as the center of focus.
